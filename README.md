Learning js from jshero.net

Problem Statement:
Write a function cutComment that takes one line of JavaScript and returns a possible line comment trimmed. If the line contains no line comment, 
null should be returned. For simplicity, we assume that the code does not contain the comment characters within a string.
Example: cutCommt('let foo; // bar') should return 'bar'.

Possible exercise for future: Write a js script to remove all the comments from a file. It doesn't matter whether it is html,css or js comment.
Hint: You can solve this with regex. Great exercise for beginner.
