Problem Statement:
Write a function cutComment that takes one line of JavaScript and returns a possible line comment trimmed. If the line contains no line comment, 
null should be returned. For simplicity, we assume that the code does not contain the comment characters within a string.
Example: cutCommt('let foo; // bar') should return 'bar'.

Possible exercise for future: Write a js script to remove all the comments from a file. It doesn't matter whether it is html,css or js comment.
Hint: You can solve this with regex. Great exercise for beginner.

Problem Statement:
Write a function lcm that takes two natural numbers and calculates their least common multiple (lcm). The lcm of two natural numbers a und b is the smallest natural number that is divisible by a and b.
Example: lcm(4, 6) should return 12

Problem Statement:
Write a function max that calculates the maximum of an arbitrary number of numbers.
Example: max(1, 2) should return 2 and max(2, 3, 1) should return 3.

Problem Statement:
Write a function add that takes a string with a summation task and returns its result as a number. A finite number of natural numbers should be added. The summation task is a string of the form '1+19+...+281'.
Example: add('7+12+100') should return 119.
