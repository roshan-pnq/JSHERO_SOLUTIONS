Problem Statement:
Write a function cutComment that takes one line of JavaScript and returns a possible line comment trimmed. If the line contains no line comment, 
null should be returned. For simplicity, we assume that the code does not contain the comment characters within a string.
Example: cutCommt('let foo; // bar') should return 'bar'.
